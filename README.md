Plotting in Matplotlib.

In this repository I will only be showing very basic and examples. The examples here can be combined to create larger, more complex plots. [My other Github page](https://github.com/mtbk24/) has a ["Research" repository](https://github.com/mtbk24/Research/) with a ["Plotting" folder](https://github.com/mtbk24/Research/tree/master/Plotting) that contains more advanced plots from some of my graduate school research studies.
